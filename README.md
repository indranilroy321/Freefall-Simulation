# Freefall Simulation in Python
Python Tutorial on Free Fall Simulation

A free fall simulation is implemented using Python programming language. No big math or physics is used but common programming sense of logic building. 

Concept of classes and objects are also used to achieve multiple falling objects. Pygame module is used for graphics and Random module is used to have objects of different sizes with different colors with different speed.
